# Installation

I've tried my best to keep installation as simple as possible. Here's a few steps you need to take to get started:


### Step 1) Get the bundle

First you need to get a hold of this bundle. There are two ways to do this:

#### Method a) Using composer

Add the following to your ``composer.json`` (see http://getcomposer.org/)

```json
    "require" :  {
        "cleentfaar/tissue-bundle": "~0.1",
    }
```

#### Method b) Using submodules

Run the following commands to bring in the needed libraries as submodules.

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/cleentfaar/TissueBundle.git vendor/bundles/CL/TissueBundle
```



### Step 2) Register the namespaces (without composer)

If you installed the bundle by composer, use the created autoload.php  (jump to step 3).
Add the following two namespace entries to the `registerNamespaces` call in your autoloader:

``` php
<?php
// app/autoload.php
$loader->registerNamespaces(array(
    // ...
    'CL\TissueBundle' => __DIR__.'/../vendor/cleentfaar/tissue-bundle',
    // ...
));
```


### Step 4) Register the bundle

To start using the bundle, register it in your Kernel:

``` php
<?php
// app/AppKernel.php

public function registerBundles()
{
    // ...
    $bundles = array(
        // ...
        new CL\TissueBundle\CLTissueBundle(),
        // ...
    );
    // ...
}
```


### Step 5) Select an adapter to use

Because the Tissue library only provides interfaces and no actual implementation; the actual virus-scanner used in your project
depends on the `adapter` you have configured the TissueBundle with.

```yml
# app/config/config.yml
cl_tissue:
    adapter: clamav # default is 'clamav'

```

By default, the `clamav` and `mock` adapters are available for you to use.

**NOTE:** The `mock` adapter should only be used for testing configurations; it does a very poor job of detecting infections!

```yml
# app/config/config_test.yml
cl_tissue:
    adapter: mock

```
